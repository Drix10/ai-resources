### 🤖 Speech-to-Speech Translation - Hibiki-Zero

This article describes Hibiki-Zero, a real-time speech-to-speech translation system that eliminates the need for word-aligned data and fragile heuristics. It details the system's reliance on sentence-level supervision and a reinforcement learning approach.

Key Points:

• Eliminates the requirement for word-aligned data.

• Avoids the use of unreliable heuristic methods.

• Leverages sentence-level supervision for improved accuracy.

• Employs a GRPO reinforcement learning recipe with partial BLEU rewards.

• Optimizes for reduced latency while maintaining high translation quality.

🚀 Implementation:
1. Prepare Sentence-Level Data: Acquire and preprocess speech and text data for sentence-level supervision.
2. Configure Reinforcement Learning: Set up the GRPO algorithm as the core learning mechanism.
3. Integrate Partial BLEU Rewards: Implement partial BLEU scores for effective reward shaping during training.
4. Train the Translation Model: Train the Hibiki-Zero model using the prepared data and RL recipe.
5. Deploy for Real-Time Inference: Set up the model for real-time speech-to-speech translation with optimized latency.
