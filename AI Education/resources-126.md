### 🤖 Maximum-Likelihood Estimators - Data-Error Relationship

This article discusses a recent paper that provides a proof concerning the relationship between data quantity and error reduction in maximum-likelihood estimators. It addresses a long-standing statistical problem, confirming that more data can lead to less error under specific conditions.

Key Points:

• A classic statistical puzzle regarding maximum-likelihood estimators has been solved.

• The paper proves that more data leads to less error beyond a minimal threshold.

• This finding holds true even for fundamental Gaussian distributions.

• A data threshold of n > d+2 is identified for error reduction.
