### 🤖 AI Models - Self-Correcting Masked Diffusion (ProSeCo)

This article outlines how a new approach, ProSeCo, addresses limitations in traditional masked diffusion models. It explains how ProSeCo integrates revision steps to enhance the quality of generated outputs by fixing errors during the generation process.

Key Points:

• Masked diffusion models are known for their speed in generation.

• Traditional models often lock in early errors, degrading final output quality.

• ProSeCo introduces interleaved revision steps for self-correction.

• The model gains the ability to fix its own mistakes on the fly.

• This self-correcting mechanism significantly improves output quality.
