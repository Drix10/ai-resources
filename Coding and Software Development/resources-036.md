### 💡 System Design Interviews - Acing the System Design Round

This article outlines a seven-step process for effectively navigating system design interview rounds, focusing on requirements clarification and subsequent design considerations.  It provides a structured approach to answering these complex questions.


Key Points:

• Thorough requirements clarification ensures a well-defined system design.


• A structured approach reduces ambiguity and improves the quality of the design.


•  Understanding both functional and non-functional requirements is crucial for success.


•  System design interviews assess problem-solving and architectural skills.


•  Effective communication is key to demonstrating understanding and design rationale.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Requirements Clarification: Begin by clarifying both functional (what the system *does*) and non-functional (how well the system *performs*) requirements. Ask probing questions to fully understand the system's core features and constraints.


2. High-Level Design:  Create a high-level architecture diagram outlining major components and their interactions.  Consider scalability, availability, and maintainability.


3. Detailed Design:  Elaborate on the chosen architecture, specifying technologies, data models, and APIs.  Address potential bottlenecks and scaling strategies.


4. Algorithm Design: Design efficient algorithms for core functionalities, considering time and space complexity.


5. Data Modeling: Define the data structures and schemas needed to store and manage system data.


6. API Design:  Design RESTful APIs or other suitable interfaces for communication between system components.
