### üí° Software Development - Avoiding Large Utility Classes

This article discusses the pitfalls of overly large utility classes in software projects and provides five rules to prevent their creation.  It focuses on the cascading effects of poorly structured code and proactive strategies for better design.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Large utility classes often indicate a lack of proper modularization.


‚Ä¢  Unforeseen consequences can arise from seemingly small changes within a monolithic utility class.


‚Ä¢  Refactoring large utility classes is a time-consuming and error-prone task.


‚Ä¢  Well-defined, smaller classes improve code readability and maintainability.


‚Ä¢  Proactive planning prevents the accumulation of code in large utility classes.



üöÄ Implementation:

1. Identify potential utility classes early:  Assess if a collection of functions truly belongs together or if they represent separate concerns.
2. Create dedicated classes: Separate functions into distinct classes based on their purpose and responsibilities.
3. Employ the Single Responsibility Principle: Ensure each class has only one reason to change.
4. Refactor existing large utility classes: Gradually break down large utility classes into smaller, more focused ones.
5. Regularly review code for potential utility class bloat:  Establish code review practices to catch potential issues before they escalate.
