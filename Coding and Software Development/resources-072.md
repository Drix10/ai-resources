### ü§ñ System Design Interviews - 24 Guiding Principles

This article presents 24 principles to effectively approach system design interviews, focusing on efficient design within time constraints.  It aims to bridge the gap between real-world project timelines and the accelerated pace of interview settings.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢  Prioritize clarity and conciseness in communication.


‚Ä¢  Focus on core functionality before adding complexities.


‚Ä¢  Employ scalable and maintainable design patterns.


‚Ä¢  Consider trade-offs between different architectural choices.


‚Ä¢  Practice articulating design decisions and rationale.



üöÄ Implementation:

1.  Define the problem scope and constraints clearly.
2.  Sketch a high-level architecture diagram.
3.  Elaborate on key components and their interactions.
4.  Discuss scalability and fault tolerance strategies.
5.  Address potential bottlenecks and limitations.
