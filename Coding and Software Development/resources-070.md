### 🤖 Design Patterns - A Concise Overview

This article briefly explains five common design patterns, illustrating their implementation using both classes and functions.  The examples provided are simplified for clarity.


Key Points:

• Singleton pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists.


• Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.


• Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object notifies its dependents of any state changes.


• Decorator pattern dynamically adds responsibilities to an object.


• Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Singleton:  Create a class with a private constructor and a static method to return the single instance.

2. Factory: Define an interface for creating objects and concrete classes implementing this interface.

3. Observer: Create a Subject class that maintains a list of observers and notifies them of changes.

4. Decorator: Create an abstract decorator class and concrete decorator classes that wrap the original object.

5. Strategy: Define an interface for algorithms and concrete classes implementing the interface.
