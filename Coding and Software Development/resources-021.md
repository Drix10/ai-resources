### 💡 Software Architecture - Top 6 Architectural Principles

This article outlines six key architectural principles for designing robust and maintainable software systems.  It provides a concise overview of these principles and their significance in software development.


Key Points:

• Separation of Concerns:  Decoupling different aspects of the system for improved modularity and maintainability.


• Single Responsibility Principle:  Each module should have only one specific responsibility.


• Open/Closed Principle:  Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.


• Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.


• Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they don't use.


• Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

### 💡 Software Architecture - Design vs. Architecture & Trade-offs

This article discusses the key differences between software design and architecture, highlighting the concept of making the "least worst" decision in architectural choices, as opposed to striving for perfection.  It also briefly touches upon the limitations of architecture.


Key Points:

• Software design focuses on the detailed implementation of individual components.


• Software architecture focuses on high-level system structure and interactions.


• Architectural trade-offs are inevitable; the goal is often to find the least worst solution, balancing competing requirements.


• Constraints, such as time, budget, and existing infrastructure, significantly influence architectural decisions.


• Understanding the limitations of architecture is crucial for managing expectations and mitigating risks.
