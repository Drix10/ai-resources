### ü§ñ Debugging - Node.js Module Loading Errors

This article analyzes a cryptic Node.js error stemming from a module loading failure, specifically focusing on the `util.types.isNativeError()` function and its role in identifying errors originating from failed `require()` calls.  The article will explain the error and offer debugging strategies.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Incorrect `isNativeError` results indicate issues with module loading.


‚Ä¢ The error likely stems from problems within the imported module itself, or its dependencies.


‚Ä¢ Thoroughly examine the module's code for syntax errors, missing dependencies, or runtime issues.


‚Ä¢ Verify that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed and accessible.


‚Ä¢ Consider using a debugger to step through the code and pinpoint the exact location of the failure.


üöÄ Implementation:

1. Identify the failing module: Examine the error message to determine which module is causing the problem.


2. Inspect the module's code: Check for syntax errors, typos, or incorrect usage of Node.js features.


3. Verify dependencies: Ensure all required packages are installed using `npm install` or `yarn install`.


4. Use a debugger: Employ Node.js debugging tools (e.g., `node --inspect`) to step through the code execution and identify the precise point of failure.


5. Check module paths: Confirm that the module's path is correctly specified in the `require()` statement.
