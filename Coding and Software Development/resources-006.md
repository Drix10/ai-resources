### ü§ñ SOLID Principles - Object-Oriented Programming

This article outlines the five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming, focusing on how they contribute to cleaner, more maintainable, and flexible code.  Each principle is briefly explained to illustrate its impact on software design.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Single Responsibility Principle:  A class should have only one reason to change.


‚Ä¢ Open/Closed Principle:  Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


‚Ä¢ Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.


‚Ä¢ Interface Segregation Principle:  Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they don't use.


‚Ä¢ Dependency Inversion Principle:  Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
