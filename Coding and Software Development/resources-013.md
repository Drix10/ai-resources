### 🤖 Software Architecture - Common Styles

This article explores common software architecture styles, their characteristics, and when they are best applied.  It provides a high-level overview of several key styles.


Key Points:

• Microservices: Independent deployable services, promoting scalability and maintainability.


• Monolithic: All components within a single application, simpler to develop and deploy initially.


• Layered:  Organized into distinct layers (presentation, business logic, data access), promoting separation of concerns.


• Event-Driven: Components communicate asynchronously through events, improving responsiveness and scalability.


• Client-Server: A central server provides services to multiple clients, a common pattern for web applications.

### 💡 Software Architecture - Top 6 Architectural Principles

This article outlines six key architectural principles for designing robust and maintainable software systems.  It provides a concise overview of these principles and their importance in software development.


Key Points:

• Separation of Concerns:  Decoupling different aspects of the system for improved modularity and maintainability.


• Single Responsibility Principle:  Each module should have only one reason to change.


• Open/Closed Principle:  Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.


• Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.


• Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they don't use.


• Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
