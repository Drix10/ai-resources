### 🤖 Microservices - Essential Design Patterns

This article lists key design patterns frequently employed in microservice architectures.  Understanding these patterns is crucial for building robust, scalable, and maintainable microservices.


Key Points:

• API Gateway: Manages external access to internal microservices, providing routing, security, and other cross-cutting concerns.


• Service Registry: Enables services to discover and communicate with each other dynamically.


• Circuit Breaker: Prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to a failing service.


• Event-Driven Architecture: Enables loosely coupled communication between services using asynchronous events.


• Database per Service: Each microservice owns its own database, promoting autonomy and simplifying data management.


🚀 Implementation:

1. Choose an API Gateway: Select a suitable API gateway based on your needs and infrastructure (e.g., Kong, Apigee).
2. Implement Service Discovery: Integrate a service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd) to enable dynamic service discovery.
3. Integrate Circuit Breaker: Use a library or framework (e.g., Hystrix, Resilience4j) to implement circuit breaker functionality.
4. Design Event-Driven Communication: Define event schemas and utilize a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.
5. Implement Database-per-Service: Ensure each microservice manages its own database instance.

### 💡 Microservices - When to Avoid Them

This article explains why starting a project with a microservices architecture might not be the best approach, even for applications anticipated to scale significantly.  It outlines the significant overhead associated with microservices.


Key Points:

• Increased team coordination overhead


• Complexities in handling failures


• Challenges related to eventual consistency


• Increased effort in automating deployments


• Added burden of managing multiple services


🚀 Implementation:

1. Start with a monolithic architecture: Develop a single, integrated application.
