### üí°  Functional Programming - Pure Functions

This article explains the concept of pure functions in programming, highlighting their benefits for code maintainability and debugging.  A simple JavaScript example is provided.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Pure functions enhance code predictability.


‚Ä¢ Pure functions simplify debugging by eliminating side effects.


‚Ä¢ Pure functions improve code reusability and testability.


‚Ä¢ Pure functions contribute to more modular and maintainable code.


üöÄ Implementation:

1. Identify impure functions: Analyze your codebase to locate functions that rely on external state or produce side effects.
2. Refactor impure functions:  Rewrite identified functions to eliminate reliance on external state and side effects, ensuring they only depend on their input parameters.
3. Test thoroughly:  Rigorously test the refactored pure functions to ensure they produce consistent output for the same input.
