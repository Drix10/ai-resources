### üí° LeetCode Strategies - Problem Solving Patterns

This article discusses three common problem-solving patterns frequently encountered on LeetCode: substring problems, sliding window techniques, and two-pointer approaches.  These patterns can significantly improve efficiency when tackling coding challenges.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Substring problems often benefit from optimized substring search algorithms.


‚Ä¢ Sliding window techniques enhance efficiency by iterating through data only once.


‚Ä¢ Two-pointer approaches allow for simultaneous traversal of data structures, reducing time complexity.


üöÄ Implementation:

1. Identify Pattern: Determine if the problem aligns with a known pattern (substring, sliding window, or two pointers).
2. Apply Template: Utilize a suitable template or algorithm based on the identified pattern.
3. Optimize: Refine the solution for improved time and space complexity.
