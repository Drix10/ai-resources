### 🤖 Software Architecture - Foundational Patterns

This article discusses the shift in software development requirements, highlighting the increasing importance of architectural knowledge alongside fundamental programming concepts.  It introduces four basic software architectures as a starting point for building high-quality software.


Key Points:

•  A strong understanding of software architecture is crucial for building high-quality software.


•  Proficiency in design patterns alone is insufficient for modern software development.


•  Four fundamental architectural patterns provide a solid foundation for various applications.


•  Choosing the right architecture depends on specific project needs and constraints.


•  Further study of software architecture principles is essential for continuous improvement.



🚀 Implementation:

1.  Identify Project Requirements: Clearly define the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.
2.  Select an Architecture: Choose an appropriate architecture (e.g., layered, microservices, event-driven, or client-server) based on the project requirements.
3.  Design Components: Design the individual components of the system and their interactions.
4.  Implement Components: Develop the individual components according to the design.
5.  Test and Deploy: Thoroughly test the integrated system and deploy it to the target environment.

### 🤖 Software Architecture - Over-engineered Web Application

This article describes a hypothetical software architecture for a web application, highlighting the use of advanced patterns like Hexagonal Architecture and CQRS, even in the absence of significant user traffic.  It explores the potential reasons behind such a design choice.

Key Points:

•  Use of Hexagonal Architecture promotes clean separation of concerns and improved testability.


•  CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern enhances scalability and performance by separating read and write operations.


•  Employing a read/write database setup optimizes data access for both read-heavy and write-heavy operations.


•  RabbitMQ is used as a message broker for asynchronous communication between components.


•  Domain events facilitate communication and maintain data consistency within the system.
