### 💡 Design Patterns - Practical Applications

This article identifies five frequently used design patterns in software development, highlighting their practical applications and likelihood of encountering them in coding projects.  It focuses on their relative importance for developers.


Key Points:

• Factory Pattern:  Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.


• Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.


• Observer Pattern (Publisher-Subscriber): Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.


• Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.


• Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.  This lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
