### 🤖 Design Patterns - A Concise Overview

This article briefly explains five common design patterns, illustrating their implementation using both classes and functions.  The examples provided are simplified for clarity.


Key Points:

• Singleton pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists.


• Factory pattern provides an interface for creating objects without specifying their concrete classes.


• Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object notifies its dependents of any state changes.


• Decorator pattern dynamically adds responsibilities to an object.


• Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Singleton:  Implement a class with a private constructor and a static method to return a single instance.  Use a static variable to hold the instance.


2. Factory: Create an interface defining a method to create objects. Implement concrete classes that implement this interface and return specific object types.


3. Observer: Define a Subject class with methods to attach and detach observers, and to notify them. Create an Observer interface with an update method. Implement concrete observer classes.


4. Decorator: Create an abstract Decorator class that wraps the original component. Implement concrete decorator classes to add specific functionality.


5. Strategy: Define a Context class that uses a Strategy interface. Implement concrete strategy classes that implement the interface and define specific algorithms.
