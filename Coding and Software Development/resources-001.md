🚀 Implementation:

1. Decompose the application into independent services based on business capabilities.
2. Design inter-service communication using protocols like REST or gRPC.
3. Implement service discovery and load balancing mechanisms.
4. Establish robust monitoring and logging for each service.
5. Implement deployment strategies such as containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) for efficient management.
