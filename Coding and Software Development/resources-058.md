### 🚀 CI/CD - GitHub Actions and Vercel Deployment

This article describes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy to Vercel.  It focuses on best practices to mitigate common developer issues like failed builds.


Key Points:

• Automated deployments reduce manual effort and human error.


• Consistent builds ensure reliable application releases.


• Version control integrates seamlessly with the CI/CD process.


• Faster feedback loops enable quicker identification and resolution of issues.


• Improved collaboration between development and operations teams.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Configure GitHub Actions Workflow: Create a YAML file defining the build, test, and deployment steps.  This file will specify the commands to build your application and deploy it to Vercel.
