### 🤖 System Design - Top 10 Concepts

This article outlines ten key system design concepts frequently encountered in technical interviews, focusing on their importance and general application in building robust and scalable systems.  It provides a concise overview for interview preparation.

Key Points:

• DNS:  Translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling name-based access to services.


• Load Balancing: Distributes network traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure high availability.


• API Gateway: Acts as a central point of entry for all client requests, managing authentication, routing, and rate limiting.


• Database: Stores and manages persistent data, crucial for application functionality and data integrity.


• Fan-out Services:  Decouples services to improve scalability and resilience by distributing workload across multiple independent units.


• Scaling: Adapting system resources to handle increasing user demand and maintain performance.


• Caching: Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce database load and improve response times.


🚀 Implementation:

1. Define Requirements: Clearly outline the functional and non-functional requirements of the system.
2. Choose Technologies: Select appropriate technologies for each component based on scalability and performance needs.
3. Design Architecture: Create a high-level architecture diagram illustrating the interaction between different components.
4. Implement and Test: Develop and thoroughly test each component individually and as a complete system.
5. Deploy and Monitor: Deploy the system to a production environment and monitor its performance closely.
