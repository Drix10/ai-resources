### 🤖 Model Finetuning - Weights & Biases Integration

This article explains how to monitor LoRA finetuning processes as they train, integrating run metrics and finetuned weights within the Weights & Biases platform. It covers the benefits of using this approach without requiring additional infrastructure.

Key Points:

• Seamlessly monitor LoRA finetuning alongside training metrics.

• Finetuned weights automatically appear in the W&B chat interface.

• Eliminates the need for complex infrastructure setup.

• Utilizes token-priced inference for cost-effective model deployment.

🚀 Implementation:
1. Log LoRA Weights: Record LoRA weights directly within Weights & Biases during the training phase.
2. Monitor Run Metrics: Observe finetuning progress and performance metrics in the W&B platform.
3. Utilize Token-Priced Inference: Deploy models and incur inference costs based on token usage.
