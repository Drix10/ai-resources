### 💡 Software Fundamentals - Database vs. Service

This article outlines the fundamental distinction between a database and a service in software architecture. Understanding these differences is crucial for effective system design and development.

Key Points:

• Databases are primarily systems designed for storing and managing data persistently.

• Services typically encapsulate business logic and perform operations or computations.

• A database acts as a passive data repository, while a service is an active functional component.

• Grasping this separation is essential for building scalable and maintainable applications.
