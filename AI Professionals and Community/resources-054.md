### ü§ñ Mechanistic Interpretability - SSMs and Transformer Architectures

This article discusses the impact of mechanistic interpretability, specifically concerning self-supervised models (SSMs) and their relation to transformer architectures.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Mechanistic interpretability, particularly from Anthropic's work on transformers, has yielded concrete results.


‚Ä¢ The H3 paper provided an architecture enabling the implementation of induction behavior discovered in transformers.


‚Ä¢ Subsequent SSM papers built upon this architecture and findings.

### ü§ñ Mechanistic Interpretability - RepE and Methodological Differences

This article explores the author's lack of understanding regarding the concrete methodological differences between the RepE agenda and other approaches within mechanistic interpretability.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ The author questions the methodological distinctiveness of the RepE agenda from other mechanistic interpretability approaches.


‚Ä¢ The author seeks clarification on what separates RepE beyond social circles.


‚Ä¢ The author expresses confusion over the vision presented.

### ü§ñ Mechanistic Interpretability - RepE and Model Behavior

This article discusses the implications of RepE-style interventions on model behavior within the context of mechanistic interpretability.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ RepE-style top-down interventions localize useful information within a model.


‚Ä¢ This approach still falls under the umbrella of mechanistic interpretability.


‚Ä¢ It remains susceptible to issues like poor out-of-distribution generalization and adversarial attacks.
