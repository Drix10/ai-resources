### 🤖 AI Attention Mechanisms - The Entropy Paradox

This article explains the entropy paradox encountered in AI models, specifically regarding attention mechanisms and their impact on learning and representation.

Key Points:

• Low entropy leads to sharp attention but hinders learning due to vanishing gradients.

• High entropy provides healthy gradients but causes representation collapse.

• Attention mechanisms drift into high-entropy zones with increased context.

• Maintaining balance between entropy levels is crucial for effective model performance.
