### üöÄ User Interfaces - Generative Interfaces for LLMs

This article introduces generative interfaces as a new paradigm for interacting with large language models (LLMs).  These interfaces dynamically adapt to user needs, replacing passive text-based interactions with more interactive and goal-oriented experiences.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Generative interfaces provide dynamic interactions with LLMs.


‚Ä¢ Interfaces adapt to user goals and needs.


‚Ä¢ This approach eliminates the need for long text blocks.
