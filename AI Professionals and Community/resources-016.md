### ü§ñ Large Language Model Training - Scaling and Performance

This article discusses the observed relationship between training compute and performance gains in large language models, specifically regarding GPQA and MATH benchmarks.  It also notes a surprising lack of enthusiasm for a significant performance improvement.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ A 10x increase in training compute resulted in a +10% improvement on GPQA and a +20% improvement on MATH in previous models.


‚Ä¢ Recent results show a 20% improvement on GPQA/AIME with a 4.5x increase in compute compared to a 4x increase.


‚Ä¢ The lack of significant excitement regarding this improvement is unexpected.
