### 🤖 LLMs - Granular Attribution with LAQuer

This article discusses LAQuer, a method for providing more granular attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs.  It focuses on reducing the amount of text users need to read to understand the source of generated facts.

Key Points:

• Allows users to highlight output facts and pinpoint the corresponding input snippets.

• Significantly reduces the text needed for attribution.

### 🤖 LLM Attribution - Comparing LAQuer Methods

This article compares two methods within LAQuer for generating citations in LLM outputs: prompting the LLM and extracting citations from internal representations.  It highlights the superior performance of prompting.

Key Points:

• Prompting the LLM for citations yields significantly shorter attributions.

•  Achieves attribution length reduction of two orders of magnitude compared to ALCE.
