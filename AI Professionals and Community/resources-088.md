### ü§ñ AI Models - World Models and Perfect Prediction

This article explores the concept of an AI model that can make perfect predictions while possessing a flawed understanding of the underlying world.  The discussion centers on a research paper presented at ICML which demonstrates this phenomenon using a solar system model.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ AI models can achieve perfect prediction without accurate world models.


‚Ä¢ A transformer model accurately predicted planetary orbits despite lacking a complete understanding of gravitational laws.


‚Ä¢ This highlights the potential disconnect between predictive accuracy and true comprehension.
