### ü§ñ Diffusion Models - Temperature Control and Composition

This article discusses the control of temperature and composition in diffusion models, specifically referencing work presented at AISTATS last year.  The focus is on diversity control within the models.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Temperature-based control allows for manipulation of generated samples' diversity.


‚Ä¢ Composition of separately trained diffusion models enhances the capabilities of the overall system.


‚Ä¢ The Feynman-Kac model formalism and score distillation were utilized in the AISTATS presentation.


‚Ä¢ SMC (Sequential Monte Carlo) methods were employed for model composition.

### ü§ñ Diffusion Models - Conservative Diffusions

This article examines the effectiveness of conservative diffusions in generative models.  The research found limited practical benefits for the datasets considered, suggesting that well-trained score models exhibit near-conservative properties.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Karras 2022 hypothesized benefits of conservative diffusions for generation.


‚Ä¢ Empirical results showed limited practical benefits of conservative diffusion.


‚Ä¢ Well-trained score models often behave conservatively.

### ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning in LLMs - Randomness and Reward

This article discusses a research paper addressing the issue of decreasing randomness and stalled score improvements in LLMs using reinforcement learning.  The paper proposes a solution to predict and fix this randomness drop.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ LLMs using reinforcement learning experience a rapid drop in randomness, followed by score stagnation.


‚Ä¢ This randomness drop is predictable and can be addressed.


‚Ä¢ An exponential link between entropy and reward is modeled to improve performance.
