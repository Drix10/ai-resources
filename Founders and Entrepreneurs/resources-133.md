### 🤖 AI Agents - One-Shot vs. Multi-Shot Loops

This article outlines the definition of one-shot versus multi-shot AI agent loops, focusing on human intervention as the distinguishing factor. It examines how agent restarts without human involvement fit into this categorization.

Key Points:

• One-shot loops involve a single execution cycle without human input.

• Multi-shot loops typically require human intervention or feedback for iteration.

• An agent restarting autonomously still qualifies as a one-shot loop if no human intervenes.

• Human intervention is the primary criterion for classifying agent loops.
