### ü§ñ Weather Forecasting - Potential US Cold Snap

This article discusses a forecaster's prediction of a significant cold snap in the US, based on observed meteorological patterns.  The prediction references a recurring 50mb vortex anomaly and its potential impact.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ A 50mb vortex anomaly, previously associated with a cold snap, is predicted to recur.


‚Ä¢ This suggests a potential for a major cold event in the US, March 20-April 15.
