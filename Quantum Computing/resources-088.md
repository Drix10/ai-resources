### ü§ñ  AI Model Bias - Attention Logit Bias

This article discusses the application of learnable bias to attention logits in AI models, specifically focusing on a technique where bias is added before the softmax function and then removed afterward.  The approach is compared to a similar method described in an ICLR2025 paper.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Learnable bias added to attention logits before softmax can improve model performance.


‚Ä¢ Removing the bias after softmax prevents potential issues caused by the bias.


‚Ä¢ This technique offers a novel approach to managing bias in attention mechanisms.
