### 🤖 Physics - Geomagnetic Field Voltage Generation

This article discusses the possibility of generating a steady electric voltage using the Earth's rotation within its geomagnetic field, presenting a counter-intuitive experimental result.

Key Points:

• Traditional understanding negated the possibility of generating steady voltage via Earth's rotation and geomagnetic field.


• A recent experiment demonstrated voltage generation using a specific structure with unique topological and mechanical properties.


• The experiment design involved a cylindrical shell and a solid cylinder as a control, mounted on a turntable.


🚀 Implementation:

1. Construct a cylindrical shell with specific dimensions (29.9 cm long in the example).
2. Create an identical solid cylinder for control purposes.
3. Mount both cylinders on a plexiglass turntable with its rotational axis aligned with the origin of an underlying coordinate system.
