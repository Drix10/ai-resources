### ü§ñ Large Language Models - Token Importance in Chain-of-Thought

This article discusses the impact of token importance on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs) and introduces TokenSkip, a technique to improve efficiency.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Not all tokens in CoT output contribute equally to the final answer.


‚Ä¢ TokenSkip allows LLMs to selectively ignore less important tokens during CoT generation.


‚Ä¢ This improves efficiency and potentially reduces computational cost.


‚Ä¢  TokenSkip may lead to faster and more efficient reasoning in LLMs.


‚Ä¢ This approach could enhance the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks.
