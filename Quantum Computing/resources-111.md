### ü§ñ Machine Learning - Spectral Clipped Weight Decay

This article details Spectral Clipped Weight Decay, a technique that selectively applies weight decay to singular values above a certain threshold.  Singular values below the threshold remain unchanged.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Applies weight decay only to singular values above a threshold.


‚Ä¢ Leaves smaller singular values unaffected.


‚Ä¢ Improves model training.
