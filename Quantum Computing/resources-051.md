### ü§ñ Message Padding in Cryptography - Implementation Details

This article details the message padding process used in cryptography, specifically focusing on padding to ensure a message length congruent to 448 mod 512 bits.  The process involves appending a '1' bit, followed by '0' bits, and a 64-bit representation of the original message length.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Ensures consistent message lengths for cryptographic algorithms.

‚Ä¢ Prevents vulnerabilities associated with inconsistent input sizes.

‚Ä¢ Maintains data integrity throughout the cryptographic process.


üöÄ Implementation:

1. Append a '1' bit to the end of the message.
2. Append sufficient '0' bits until the length is congruent to 448 mod 512.
3. Append a 64-bit integer representing the original message length in bits.
