### ü§ñ Model Behavior - Countable Hypothesis Bounds

This article discusses the limitations of Rademacher complexity and VC dimension in explaining certain model behaviors and introduces countable hypothesis bounds with a prior as an alternative explanation.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Rademacher complexity and VC dimension are insufficient to explain all model behaviors.


‚Ä¢ Countable hypothesis bounds with a prior offer a more comprehensive explanation.


‚Ä¢ This approach does not penalize the size of the hypothesis space.
