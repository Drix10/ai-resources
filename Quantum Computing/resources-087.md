### ü§ñ  Singular Value Behavior in mclip3 - NS Iterations

This article discusses unexpected singular value dropping behavior observed in the mclip3 model after increasing the number of NS iterations.  A solution involving nested msigns is presented.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Increased NS iterations led to mclip3 dropping singular values below a threshold.

‚Ä¢ Nesting msigns resolved the singular value dropping issue.

‚Ä¢ The solution improves the model's stability and reliability.

### ü§ñ Muon Model Training Challenges - Weight Decay

This article examines challenges encountered while training a Muon model with weight decay, specifically its failure to "grok" within 1000 steps even after hyperparameter tuning.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Muon model with weight decay (0.1 and 0.01) failed to converge within 1000 steps.

‚Ä¢ Hyperparameter tuning did not resolve the convergence issue.

‚Ä¢ Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying cause.
