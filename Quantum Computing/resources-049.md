### ü§ñ Relativity - The Terrell-Penrose Effect

This article discusses the Terrell-Penrose effect, a relativistic visual phenomenon observed when objects approach the speed of light.  It explains the appearance of such objects from the perspective of a stationary observer.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ The Terrell-Penrose effect describes how the shape of a fast-moving object appears distorted to a stationary observer.


‚Ä¢ This distortion is a consequence of the finite speed of light and the relativistic effects on time and space.


‚Ä¢ The effect is not due to length contraction alone, but also involves the time it takes for light from different parts of the object to reach the observer.

### ü§ñ Cross-Lingual Reasoning - Language Models

This article examines the zero-shot cross-lingual reasoning capabilities of language models fine-tuned on English data.  It highlights the "quote-and-think" pattern and limitations in cross-lingual and new-domain reasoning.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ English-trained language models exhibit zero-shot cross-lingual reasoning using a "quote-and-think" method.


‚Ä¢ This capability does not imply consistent reasoning across all languages or domains.


‚Ä¢ Further research is needed to understand the limitations and improve cross-lingual reasoning performance.
