### 🤖 Integer Arithmetic and Prime Numbers

This article discusses a problem involving finding the sum of all positive integers where subtracting the number of ones in their binary representation results in a prime number.


Key Points:

•  Involves converting integers to binary.

•  Counting the number of ones in the binary representation.

•  Determining if the result of subtraction is a prime number.


🚀 Implementation:

1. Convert n to binary: Express the integer n in its binary form.
2. Count ones: Determine the number of 1s in the binary representation.
3. Subtract and check for primality: Subtract the count of ones from n and check if the result is prime.
