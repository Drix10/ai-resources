### ü§ñ Multi-Step Translation (MLT) - Synthetic Testbed for CEL

This article discusses a multi-step translation (MLT) task designed as a synthetic testbed for contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP).  It highlights the challenges of training vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) models on this task.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ MLT task uses multiple translation steps and circular shifts.


‚Ä¢ Vanilla SFT requires exponentially many samples without in-context information.


‚Ä¢ Discretization mismatch errors are identified as a root cause for non-resolution invariance.
