### ü§ñ Mathematics - Left/Right Cancellable Functions

This article explores the concept of left and right cancellable functions in mathematics, illustrating their properties using injective and surjective mappings. The focus is on the equivalence between the injectivity/surjectivity of a function and the injectivity of induced maps on Hom-sets.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢  A function is injective if and only if its induced map on Hom-sets is injective.


‚Ä¢ A function is surjective if and only if its induced map on Hom-sets is injective.


‚Ä¢ This equivalence provides a categorical perspective on injectivity and surjectivity.
