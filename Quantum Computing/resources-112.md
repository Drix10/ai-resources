### 🤖 Earth's Atmosphere - Heat Regulation

This article explains the role of Earth's atmosphere in regulating the planet's temperature through the absorption and re-radiation of heat from the sun.

Key Points:

• Earth's atmosphere acts as a heat blanket.


• Atmospheric gases trap heat, preventing it from escaping into space.


• Without an atmosphere, Earth would be significantly colder.
