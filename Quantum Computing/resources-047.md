### ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback - Reward Model Challenges

This article examines challenges in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), specifically focusing on reward model training and evaluation methodologies. The limitations of standard sampling techniques for measuring alignment are highlighted.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ RLHF involves training a reward model and solving a KL-regularized reward maximization problem.


‚Ä¢ Success is typically measured by the win rate of samples from the alignment model against a base model.


‚Ä¢ Current evaluation methods, such as standard sampling, may not fully capture alignment success.

### ü§ñ Large Language Model Alignment - Train/Inference Mismatch

This article discusses the train/inference mismatch in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the potential for improving model alignment during inference using methods like Best-of-N and Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Standard RLHF focuses on improving the trained model, neglecting inference-time behavior.


‚Ä¢ Inference-time procedures like Best-of-N and CoT are crucial for LLM performance.


‚Ä¢ A train/inference mismatch arises from the discrepancy between training and inference optimization.
