### 🤖 Quantum Computing - Random Partition QFT

This article describes an experimental observation in quantum computing concerning the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) applied to randomly partitioned qubits. It details how this specific setup influences the resulting Fourier space.

Key Points:

• Utilizing 10 qubits in superposition with a random pre-split creates distinct outcomes.

• A single Quantum Fourier Transform application leads to a fractured Fourier space.

• The resulting landscape is asymmetric, diverging from a unified structure.

• One half of the Fourier space undergoes collapse into a flat, near-thermal distribution.
