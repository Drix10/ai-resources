Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Negative Log-Likelihood is a standard objective for classification and SFT.

‚Ä¢ Its universal optimality across all scenarios is being questioned.

‚Ä¢ Alternative objectives can outperform NLL in certain contexts.

‚Ä¢ Performance hinges on factors like objective's prior-leaningness.

‚Ä¢ Model characteristics also influence the choice of optimal objective.

### ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning Theory - Information Theory of Policy Gradients in Bayesian RL

This article formalizes an insight regarding policy gradient learning, demonstrating that it acquires approximately one bit of information per episode within a Bayesian Reinforcement Learning framework. It further proves this to be an information-theoretic ceiling and extends the analysis to actor-critic methods.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Policy gradient learning has an information-theoretic limit.

‚Ä¢ Approximately one bit of information is learned per episode in Bayesian RL.

‚Ä¢ This finding is inspired by the "LoRA Without Regret" concept.

‚Ä¢ The analysis extends to cover actor-critic reinforcement learning methods.

‚Ä¢ This provides a fundamental understanding of policy gradient efficiency.

### ü§ñ Large Language Models - Nudging LLMs for Enhanced Reasoning (NuRL)

This article introduces NuRL (Nudging the Boundaries of LLM Reasoning), an approach designed to overcome limitations of traditional methods like GRPO. It explains how NuRL aims to improve LLM reasoning by addressing hard-to-solve samples that current models often fail to learn from effectively.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ GRPO improves LLM reasoning but has limitations with difficult samples.

‚Ä¢ Hard samples often remain unsolvable and provide no meaningful gradients.

‚Ä¢ NuRL proposes a method to "nudge" LLMs beyond their comfort zone.

‚Ä¢ This nudging aims to enable LLMs to tackle previously intractable problems.

‚Ä¢ NuRL seeks to broaden the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
