### üí° Technology Adoption - Logistic Curves

This article discusses the nature of technology adoption, contrasting exponential growth with logistic curves and illustrating the concept with the example of the steam engine.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Technology adoption often follows an S-curve (logistic curve) rather than exponential growth.


‚Ä¢  Technologies may reach scaling limits, even if not "stuck" or slowing down.


‚Ä¢ Underlying technologies may change, allowing for continued progress beyond initial limits.
