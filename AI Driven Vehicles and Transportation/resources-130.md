### 🤖 Code Generation - Infinite Codegen with Agents

This article explores the concept of using coding agents to generate code that, in turn, generates more code. It covers the implications of this recursive approach to software development.

Key Points:

• AI agents can be tasked with creating code.

• The generated code can be used to prompt further agent actions.

• This enables a recursive or infinite code generation process.

• The approach allows for meta-programming capabilities with AI.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Define the initial task for the primary coding agent.
2. Instruct the agent to generate code for a subsequent agent or process.
3. Execute the newly generated code to trigger further development cycles.
