### 🤖 Video Generation - Video-As-Prompt (VAP)

This article introduces Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a novel approach for video generation. It details how VAP enables models to follow semantic instructions without requiring retraining or task-specific modifications.

Key Points:

• Enables video generation using semantic instructions without retraining

• Utilizes a reference video as an in-context semantic prompt

• Steers a frozen Video DiT model for generation control

• Incorporates a plug-and-play MoT expert for temporal consistency


🚀 Implementation:
1. Define Semantic Instructions: Formulate the desired video output with clear semantic prompts.
2. Select Reference Video: Provide a source video to act as an in-context guide.
3. Integrate MoT Expert: Implement the plug-and-play MoT expert for temporal steering.
4. Execute Video DiT Model: Run the frozen Video DiT model guided by the prompt and expert.
