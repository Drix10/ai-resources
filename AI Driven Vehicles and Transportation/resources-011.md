### ü§ñ AGI - The "I Don't Know" Problem

This article discusses a research paper arguing that the inability of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to reliably respond "I don't know" is a significantly harder problem than text generation, and that AGI hallucinations are inevitable.  The paper provides mathematical proofs supporting this claim.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ The paper formally proves the inevitability of AGI hallucinations.

‚Ä¢  A significant portion of the paper is dedicated to supplementary mathematical proofs.

‚Ä¢ The "I don't know" problem highlights a crucial limitation in current AGI development.
