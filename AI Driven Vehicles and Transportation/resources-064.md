### ü§ñ Climate Change - Reframing the Problem

This article discusses the complexities of climate change, challenging the conventional focus solely on emissions reduction.  It highlights the disproportionate contribution of developing countries to emissions in recent years.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Developing countries have significantly increased emissions while developed countries have reduced theirs at a much slower rate.


‚Ä¢  The current framing of climate change as primarily an emissions reduction problem is an oversimplification.


‚Ä¢ A broader perspective, encompassing other factors beyond emissions, is necessary for effective climate action.
