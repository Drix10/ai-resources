### 🤖 Perception - Range vs. Acuity

This article clarifies the distinction between "range" and "acuity" in technical contexts, emphasizing that these two metrics measure different aspects of system performance. Understanding this difference is critical for accurate evaluation and design.

Key Points:

• Range defines the overall scope or extent a system can perceive or operate within.

• Acuity refers to the precision or detail with which a system can discern information.

• Higher range does not automatically imply higher acuity, as they are independent measures.

• Differentiating these metrics ensures comprehensive system assessment.
