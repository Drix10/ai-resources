### ü§ñ 6G Communication Systems - The Necessity of Digital Twins

This article discusses the limitations of current digital twins and argues for the necessity of advanced, "real" digital twins in next-generation communication systems like 6G.  The core argument emphasizes the need for digital twins capable of learning, prediction, and action, beyond simple simulation.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢  A static digital twin is merely a simulator, lacking the crucial capacity for learning and prediction.


‚Ä¢  "Real" digital twins are essential for effective 6G network management and optimization.


‚Ä¢  The ability to learn, predict, and act distinguishes a real digital twin from a simple simulator.
