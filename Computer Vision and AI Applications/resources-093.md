### 🤖 Vision Model Evaluation - Language Bias Detection

This article discusses the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for evaluating vision models and detecting language biases within them.  It highlights the need for dedicated methods to assess non-language capabilities like spatial understanding.

Key Points:

• LLMs offer comprehensive evaluation of vision models.


• Language biases are frequently uncovered using LLMs.


•  Further development requires methods for evaluating non-linguistic aspects of vision models.
