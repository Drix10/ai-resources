### ü§ñ Power Consumption in Serdes-Based Links

This article clarifies the misunderstanding surrounding energy/bit calculations for Serdes-based links, emphasizing that their power consumption is largely static.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Serdes-based links consume power regardless of utilization.


‚Ä¢  pj/bit calculations are misleading as they reflect full utilization, not typical usage.


‚Ä¢ Accurate power assessment requires considering static power consumption.

### ü§ñ Power Optimization in Wide-Parallel Links

This article explains how integrating wide-parallel links can significantly improve power and performance efficiency by constraining parallelism.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Wide-parallel links offer dynamic energy usage.


‚Ä¢ Constraining parallelism allows for better PPA (Power, Performance, Area) characteristics.


‚Ä¢ This approach leads to drastic improvements in traffic-related power consumption.

### üí° Serdes Link Power Consumption Clarification

This article summarizes the key takeaway regarding power consumption in Serdes based links. Real-world applications don't constantly utilize network bandwidth at maximum capacity, but require high throughput during critical operations.  Because Serdes links are always on, the actual power consumption per bit is higher than advertised.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Real-world applications don't maintain constant network utilization.


‚Ä¢ High throughput is needed during critical operations.


‚Ä¢ Serdes-based links consume power continuously, regardless of usage.
