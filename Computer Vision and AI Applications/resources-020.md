### üöÄ Reinforcement Learning - Model Distillation in RL Swarm

This article describes a model distillation technique used in RL Swarm, where local models improve based on the outputs of other models within the swarm.  Various model types can be incorporated.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Local models in RL Swarm improve through distillation.


‚Ä¢ Distillation leverages outputs from various models (pre-trained, personalized, etc.).


‚Ä¢ This approach enhances the performance and adaptability of the swarm.
