### ü§ñ Image Processing - Denoising for Regularization

This article discusses the use of image denoisers to regularize ill-posed problems, highlighting the concept of Regularization by Denoising (RED).  The approach leverages the geometric understanding of image manifolds inherent in effective denoisers.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Denoisers understand image geometry.


‚Ä¢ This geometric understanding allows for regularization of ill-posed problems.


‚Ä¢ RED (Regularization by Denoising) leverages this property.


‚Ä¢ RED has shown significant practical impact.

### üí° Game Theory - Optimal Guessing Strategies

This article explains why 27 is a frequently occurring optimal guess in a 1-50 number guessing game, and 47 in a 1-100 game, using adversarial game theory.  The explanation focuses on the strategic implications of "higher" or "lower" feedback.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Optimal guessing strategies depend on adversarial game theory.


‚Ä¢ "Higher" or "lower" feedback influences the strategy.


‚Ä¢ The optimal guess isn't necessarily the median.


‚Ä¢  27 and 47 represent optimized guesses based on game dynamics.
