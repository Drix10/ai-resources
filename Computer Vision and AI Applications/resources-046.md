### ü§ñ Object Detection Architectures - DETR vs. Pix2Seq

This article compares two object detection architectures, DETR and Pix2Seq, explaining why DETR-like architectures are more prevalent.  The core difference lies in how they handle object ordering.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ DETR uses N query tokens and Hungarian matching for object detection.


‚Ä¢ Pix2Seq relies on invented sorting methods and predicts a sequence ending with an EOF token.


‚Ä¢ DETR's approach is more widely adopted in practice.
