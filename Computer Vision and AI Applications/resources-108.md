### ü§ñ AI Limitations - Language Models and Spatial Intelligence

This article explores Fei-Fei Li's perspective on the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding spatial intelligence.  The core argument highlights the disconnect between the generated nature of language and the physical, 3D world.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Language is an artificial construct, unlike the laws of physics governing the 3D world.


‚Ä¢ LLMs struggle with spatial reasoning due to their reliance on linguistic data.


‚Ä¢  Understanding spatial intelligence requires grounding in physical reality.
