### ü§ñ Game Theory - Optimal Guessing Strategy

This article explains the optimal strategy for the number guessing game, where the chooser provides feedback ("higher" or "lower").  The analysis utilizes adversarial game theory to determine the statistically optimal first guess.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Adversarial game theory predicts the optimal first guess.


‚Ä¢ The optimal first guess minimizes the expected number of guesses required.


‚Ä¢ The optimal first guess is not always the middle number.


‚Ä¢  The optimal first guess depends on the range of possible numbers.


‚Ä¢ This strategy provides a framework for optimizing decision making under uncertainty.

### üí° Startup Advice - Minimum Believers Needed

This article discusses the minimum number of people a founder needs to believe in their startup idea to achieve success. It counters the idea that broad initial support is crucial.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢  A founder's self-belief is paramount.


‚Ä¢  Securing belief from one other person can suffice.


‚Ä¢  External validation is valuable but not strictly necessary for early success.


‚Ä¢  Outliers prove the irrelevance of average success metrics.

### ü§ñ Robotics - Proactive Robot Assistance

This article introduces the concept of a proactive robot assistant, "Casper," that anticipates user needs instead of passively responding to commands.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Casper aims to provide anticipatory assistance.


‚Ä¢ The robot infers user intentions through active sensing.


‚Ä¢  The system allows the user to retain control.


‚Ä¢  This approach represents a shift from reactive to proactive robotics.
