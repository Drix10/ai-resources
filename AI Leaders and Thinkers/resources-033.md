### ü§ñ Bias Correction in Dr. GRPO - Leave-One-Out Proximal Policy

This article discusses a bias correction method for Dr. GRPO, a group-based policy optimization algorithm.  The correction addresses a bias more pronounced in smaller group sizes, leading to a more unbiased alternative called LOOP (Leave-One-Out Proximal Policy).

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Dr. GRPO exhibits bias, particularly in smaller groups.

‚Ä¢ Multiplying Dr. GRPO's A_i by the correction term N/N-1 removes this bias.


‚Ä¢ The corrected algorithm is called LOOP (Leave-One-Out Proximal Policy).
