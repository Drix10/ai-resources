### 🤖 3D Rendering Workflow - Claude, Magnific, Runway

This article details a workflow for creating stylized 3D renders using Claude 3.7, Magnific, and Runway's Restyle.  The process involves generating renders, manipulating camera angles, and then using AI for stylistic enhancement.

Key Points:

• Leverages Claude 3.7 for 3D model generation and camera control.

• Utilizes Magnific for structural referencing and image refinement.

• Employs Runway Gen-3 for video processing and frame extraction.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Generate 3D renders within Claude 3.7.
2. Programmatically control camera movements within the 3D environment.
3. Screen record the rendered animation.
4. Upload the video to Runway Gen-3 for processing.
5. Extract the first frame from the processed video.
6. Use Magnific for structural referencing and refinement of the extracted frame.
7. Upload the refined image for further processing or use.
