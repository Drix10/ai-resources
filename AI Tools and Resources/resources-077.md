### 🤖 Large Language Models - Simple Test-Time Scaling

This article discusses a method for scaling the performance of large language models (LLMs) at test time, using a technique called "budget forcing" to control thinking duration.  The approach demonstrates strong reasoning capabilities even with limited training data.


Key Points:

• Training on a smaller dataset (1000 samples) is sufficient.


•  Next-token prediction is used during training.


•  Test-time performance scales with increased budget (allocated thinking time).


•  "Budget forcing" controls the model's thinking duration.


•  Strong reasoning capabilities are achieved with this method.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Train the model using next-token prediction on a dataset of approximately 1000 samples.
2. Implement the "budget forcing" technique to control the model's reasoning time during inference.
3. Adjust the budget (thinking duration) to optimize performance for the specific task.
4. Evaluate the model's performance across different budget settings.
5. Iterate on steps 2-4 to fine-tune the budget for optimal results.
