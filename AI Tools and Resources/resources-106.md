### ü§ñ Large Language Models - Architectural Comparisons and Applications

This article summarizes discussions with AI leaders regarding the architecture of DeepSeek and o1,  highlights key LLM performance benchmarks, and touches upon the use of tools for LLM video creation.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ DeepSeek and o1 are complex systems incorporating LLMs as modules, not pure LLMs.


‚Ä¢  The Arena-Price Plot visualizes the performance-cost trade-offs of various LLMs, including Gemini-2.0-Flash/Lite, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Yi-Lightning, and Ministral 8B.


‚Ä¢  LLM video creation can be achieved using readily available tools like OBS and iMovie.


‚Ä¢ Multilayer perceptrons with one hidden layer can overcome the curse of dimensionality for Barron's functions.


üöÄ Implementation:

1. Video Recording: Utilize OBS for recording multiple takes of video clips.
2. Video Editing: Employ iMovie for stitching together the recorded clips.
