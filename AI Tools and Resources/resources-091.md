### 💡 Communication - Ineffectiveness of Fact-Based Arguments

This article discusses the futility of relying solely on facts and logic when communicating with individuals who exhibit irrational or dismissive behavior.  It highlights the limitations of such an approach and offers a metaphorical explanation for its ineffectiveness.


Key Points:

• Fact-based arguments are ineffective against individuals resistant to reason.


• Logical inconsistencies and hypocrisy may be ignored by those unwilling to engage constructively.


•  Attempting to reason with such individuals is akin to engaging in a futile debate.


•  The metaphorical comparison to "playing chess with a hyena" illustrates the inherent imbalance of power and the futility of the endeavor.
