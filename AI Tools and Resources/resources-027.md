### ü§ñ Large Language Models - Dynamic Mode Switching

This article demonstrates how tools enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically switch between summarization and question-answering modes, leveraging metadata retrieval for improved results.  The example focuses on the integration of these functionalities.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Dynamic mode switching enhances LLM adaptability.


‚Ä¢ Metadata retrieval improves response accuracy and relevance.


‚Ä¢ Combining summarization and Q&A capabilities broadens LLM applications.


‚Ä¢ This approach allows for more nuanced and context-aware responses.


‚Ä¢  Improved efficiency in handling diverse user requests.



üöÄ Implementation:

1. Integrate Metadata Retrieval: Implement a system to access and process relevant metadata alongside the main text.
2. Develop Mode Switching Logic: Create a mechanism to determine the appropriate LLM mode (summarization or Q&A) based on user input and retrieved metadata.
3. Connect to LLM Provider: Integrate with an LLM provider's API to send requests and receive responses.
4. Implement Response Handling: Develop a system to process and format the LLM's responses according to the chosen mode.
5. Test and Refine: Thoroughly test the system with various inputs and refine the logic as needed.
