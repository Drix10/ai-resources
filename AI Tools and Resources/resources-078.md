### 🤖 Large Language Models - Ethical Considerations in Deployment

This article discusses the appropriate placement of ethical considerations and safety measures when deploying large language models (LLMs).  It argues against embedding these features directly into the model itself.

Key Points:

• Embedding ethical constraints within LLMs limits their flexibility and adaptability to diverse contexts.


• Security and content filtering are best implemented at the deployment level, allowing for granular control and easier updates.
