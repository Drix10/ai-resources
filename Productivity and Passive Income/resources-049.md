### 🤖 Gradient Descent - Optimization Algorithm

This article provides a concise overview of gradient descent, a fundamental algorithm in optimization, explaining its core functionality and practical considerations for choosing descent direction and step size.


Key Points:

• Gradient descent iteratively minimizes a function by moving in the direction of the negative gradient.


• The choice of descent direction impacts convergence speed and potential for getting stuck in local minima.


• Step size (learning rate) determines the magnitude of each update, affecting convergence speed and stability.


🚀 Implementation:

1. Define the objective function: Formulate the mathematical function to be minimized.
2. Calculate the gradient: Compute the gradient of the objective function.
3. Update parameters: Iterate, adjusting parameters in the direction of the negative gradient, scaled by the step size.
4. Monitor convergence: Track the objective function value to assess convergence.  Choose a stopping criterion (e.g., maximum iterations or a threshold for change in objective function value).
