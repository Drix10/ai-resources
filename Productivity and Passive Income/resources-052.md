### ü§ñ Gradient Descent - Optimization Algorithm

This article provides a concise overview of gradient descent, a fundamental algorithm in optimization, explaining its core mechanics and practical considerations for choosing descent direction and step size.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Gradient descent iteratively minimizes a function by moving in the direction of the negative gradient.
