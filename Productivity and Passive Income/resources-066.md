### 🤖 FreeCAD Project - Combining Digital and Traditional Fabrication

This article discusses a FreeCAD project that integrates traditional fabrication techniques with digital tools, highlighting the challenges and advantages of this hybrid approach.  The project involves 3D scanning using an EinStar scanner and demonstrates how manual problem-solving complements digital design capabilities.


Key Points:

• Combining traditional and digital fabrication methods can enhance design flexibility.


• FreeCAD's capabilities extend to handling complex geometries arising from traditional techniques.


• This approach allows for "fudging" solutions, mimicking manual adjustments in a digital environment.


• The project showcases the complementary nature of digital and analog fabrication processes.


🚀 Implementation:

1. 3D Scan the Object: Use a 3D scanner (e.g., EinStar) to capture the object's geometry.
2. Import Scan Data: Import the scan data into FreeCAD for manipulation and design refinement.
3. Model and Design: Use FreeCAD's tools to create or modify the design based on the scan data.
4. Generate Fabrication Instructions: Use FreeCAD to generate instructions for fabrication (e.g., G-code for CNC machining).
5. Fabricate the Object: Employ traditional and/or digital fabrication techniques to create the final object.
