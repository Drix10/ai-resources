### ü§ñ LLMs as Judges - Taming the Wild West

This article discusses the challenges of using Large Language Models (LLMs) as evaluation tools and presents a Test-Driven-Development (TDD) workflow to improve their accuracy and reliability.  LLMs often produce unreliable results out-of-the-box.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ LLMs used for judging require careful calibration to avoid inaccurate or misleading results.


‚Ä¢ A Test-Driven-Development workflow helps improve LLM accuracy and reliability.


‚Ä¢  Implementing a TDD workflow mitigates the inherent biases and inconsistencies in LLMs.
