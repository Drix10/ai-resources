### 🤖 Production Observability - Interface-First Approach

This article provides a detailed analysis of why robust observability is crucial for production systems, explaining the limitations of traditional monitoring methods. It argues for initiating observability directly at the system's interface.

Key Points:

• Most system failures remain undetected without proper observability.

• Dashboards alone are insufficient for comprehensive fault detection.

• Effective observability must originate at the system interface.

• Proactive monitoring is essential for production environments.

### 💡 AI Product Development - Automation Progression

This article addresses common pitfalls in implementing cloud agents for AI solutions, attributing failures not to poor AI but to skipped steps in the automation journey. It outlines a progression from manual to event-driven automation.

Key Points:

• Successful AI automation requires a staged approach.

• Progress from manual processes to event-driven systems.

• Automation capabilities must be gradually developed.

• Skipping steps in the automation lifecycle leads to failure.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Manual Phase: Establish basic operations without automation.
2. Reviewed Phase: Implement checks and human oversight for processes.
3. Scheduled Phase: Automate tasks based on predefined schedules.
4. Event-driven Phase: Develop systems that react dynamically to events.
