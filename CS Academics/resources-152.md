### 🤖 Software Engineering - Undefined Behavior in C++

This article addresses a specific instance of undefined behavior (UB) in C++ related to the order of operations between incrementing a `used_objects` counter and performing a placement new. It emphasizes the importance of exception safety.

Key Points:

• Incrementing `used_objects` before placement new can lead to undefined behavior.

• Exception safety requires careful ordering of resource allocation and state updates.

• A constructor throwing an exception can leave the system in an inconsistent state.

• Correct sequencing prevents resource leaks and corrupted object counts.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Initialize Counter: Ensure `used_objects` is not incremented prematurely.
2. Perform Placement New: Construct the object using `placement new`.
3. Handle Exceptions: Implement mechanisms to catch constructor exceptions.
4. Increment Counter: Increment `used_objects` only after successful construction.
