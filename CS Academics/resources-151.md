### 🤖 Neural Networks - Grokking Phenomenon

Grokking describes a phenomenon where neural networks generalize perfectly after extensive training without apparent learning. This article explains this sudden shift from memorization to generalization in models.

Key Points:

• Neural networks can undergo extended training periods without demonstrating learning.

• Grokking involves a sudden transition to perfect generalization in a single epoch.

• Initially perceived as a glitch, Grokking is now a foundational theory in model behavior.

### 🤖 AI Seminars - Scaled Dot-Product Attention

This article explains the foundational concept of Scaled Dot-Product Attention, a key mechanism in transformer models. It outlines the initial steps involved in computing attention scores.

Key Points:

• Scaled Dot-Product Attention is a core component of modern AI models.

• The first step involves comparing a query token against all key tokens.

• Dot products are used to generate similarity scores between queries and keys.

• Scaling and softmax normalize these scores into attention weights.

• The final step creates a weighted sum of values based on these weights.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Compare Query and Keys: Take a token as a query and compare it against all keys using dot products.
2. Compute Similarity Scores: Generate a grid of similarity scores for every query against every key.
3. Scale Scores: Divide the similarity scores by the square root of the key's dimension.
4. Apply Softmax: Use a softmax function to convert scaled scores into attention weights.
5. Generate Output: Calculate a weighted sum of corresponding values using the attention weights.
