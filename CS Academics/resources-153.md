### 🤖 Go Concurrency - Avoiding Goroutine Leaks

This article discusses concurrency patterns in Go, focusing on techniques to prevent goroutine leaks. It highlights best practices for managing goroutines to ensure efficient resource utilization in Go applications.

Key Points:

• Properly manage goroutine lifecycles to prevent resource exhaustion.

• Implement cancellation mechanisms for long-running concurrent operations.

• Utilize Go's `context` package for robust goroutine management.

• Apply select statements with channels to control goroutine termination.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Understand Goroutine Lifecycle: Recognize when a goroutine is created and when it should exit.
2. Implement Context Cancellation: Use `context.WithCancel` to signal goroutines to stop.
3. Use Channel Communication: Employ channels to gracefully shut down goroutines.
