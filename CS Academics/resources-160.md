### 🤖 AI/ML - Self-distillation with Privileged Information

This article discusses the concept of self-distillation in machine learning, specifically exploring its potential when enhanced with privileged information. It considers how a model's performance could be influenced by the subtle integration of such information during training.

Key Points:

• Self-distillation involves a model learning from its own predictions to improve.

• Privileged information offers additional, high-quality data during training.

• Success depends on how the model leverages privileged information effectively.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Define a Teacher Model: Train an initial model, potentially with access to privileged information.
2. Generate Soft Targets: Use the teacher model to create soft probability distributions for unlabeled data.
3. Train a Student Model: Distill knowledge by training a student model on these soft targets.
