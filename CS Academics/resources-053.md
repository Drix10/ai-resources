### ü§ñ Processor Power States - DVFS Analysis

This article analyzes Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) in processors, showing how they operate across a limited set of voltage and frequency pairs.  The analysis simplifies DVFS output representation using only frequency.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Processors utilize a small subset of voltage-frequency pairs for operation.

‚Ä¢ Each operating point possesses a unique frequency.

‚Ä¢ Frequency alone can effectively represent DVFS outputs.
