### 🤖 AI Models - Extended Context Windows

This article covers a breakthrough by MIT researchers in overcoming context window limitations for large language models. It details how 10 million-plus token prompts are now achievable by integrating context into external code environments.

Key Points:

• Eliminates traditional context window size restrictions.

• Enables processing of prompts exceeding 10 million tokens.

• Integrates context dynamically within external code.

• Enhances LLM capabilities for processing vast information.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Integrate External Context: Store and manage contextual information outside the LLM.
2. Employ Code Environments: Utilize code for dynamic context retrieval and injection.
3. Process Large Prompts: Construct prompts exceeding traditional token limits.
