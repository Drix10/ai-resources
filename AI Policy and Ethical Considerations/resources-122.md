### 🤖 Human Genetics - Allele Frequency and Trait Prediction

This article explains a method for predicting a specific genetic trait within a population based on allele frequency. It references the ABCC11 gene and the rs17822931 SNP, which is associated with human earwax type and body odor.

Key Points:

• Predicts specific genetic traits using population-wide allele frequencies.

• Focuses on the ABCC11 gene, associated with body odor and earwax.

• Involves squaring the minor allele frequency to determine homozygosity.

• Illustrates the application of basic population genetics principles.

🚀 Implementation:
1. Identify the target allele's worldwide minor allele frequency (e.g., the "blue" allele for ABCC11 rs17822931).
2. Square this frequency to estimate the proportion of homozygous individuals.
3. Use the calculated proportion to infer the prevalence of the associated trait in a population.
