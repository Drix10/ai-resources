### ü§ñ Model Creativity and RLHF - Token Trajectory Blocking

This article examines the potential cause of reduced creativity in large language models after Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).  It suggests that the reduction in creativity stems from the blocking of token trajectories during the RLHF process.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ RLHF can negatively impact model creativity.


‚Ä¢  Token probabilities can be reduced to near zero during RLHF.


‚Ä¢  This may block the generation of certain tokens, regardless of relevance.
