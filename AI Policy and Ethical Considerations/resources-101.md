### üí° UBI Experiments - Scale and Feasibility

This article discusses the potential effects of different scales of Universal Basic Income (UBI) experiments and the challenges in implementing larger-scale trials.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ A significantly larger UBI ($10,000/month) could reveal substantial effects not seen in smaller trials.


‚Ä¢ Current policy feasibility limits UBI experiments to smaller amounts ($1,000/month).


‚Ä¢ AI-driven economic growth may make larger UBI experiments feasible in the future.
