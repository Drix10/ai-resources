### 🤖 Fine-tuning - Model Quality Comparison

This article outlines the importance of layer quality metrics when fine-tuning models, ensuring performance is maintained or improved. It specifically compares an instruction fine-tuned model against its base version to evaluate these metrics.

Key Points:

• Fine-tuned models should achieve layer quality metrics at least equal to their base models.

• Instruction fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct is evaluated against its base Qwen2.5-14B.

• This comparison ensures the fine-tuning process yields beneficial performance enhancements.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Train the instruction fine-tuned model from a base model.
2. Evaluate and collect layer quality metrics for the fine-tuned model.
3. Compare these metrics directly with those of the base model.
4. Verify that fine-tuned performance meets or exceeds base model standards.
