### 💡 AI Agents - Best Practices for Implementation

This article provides practical habits for implementing AI agents effectively, focusing on model selection, observability, memory management, and prompt optimization.

Key Points:

• Select AI models explicitly based on task requirements.

• Utilize agent logs for enhanced observability and evaluation.

• Prioritize stateless designs for initial agent configurations.

• Optimize prompt size to prevent growing huge.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Choose specific models: Select cheaper models for managers and stronger coders for CodeAgents.
2. Implement observability: Use `agent.logs` and `write_inner_inner_memory_from_logs()` for tracking and evaluation.
3. Start stateless: Begin with agents that have no memory.
4. Add memory incrementally: Introduce simple memory only when a clear need arises.
