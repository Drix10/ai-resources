### üöÄ  AI-Assisted 3D Rendering Workflow

This article details a workflow using Claude 3.7, Magnific, and Runway Restyle to create 3D renders and stylized video outputs.  The process involves several steps, from initial 3D modeling to final video enhancement.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Leveraging Claude 3.7 for efficient 3D model creation.

‚Ä¢ Utilizing Magnific for structural refinement of the initial frame.


‚Ä¢ Employing Runway Gen-3 for video enhancement and stylization.


üöÄ Implementation:
1. Build 3D Renders in Claude 3.7: Create the initial 3D model and environment.
2. Program camera movements: Define the desired camera angles and movements within the 3D scene.
3. Screen record render: Capture a video of the rendered scene.
4. Upload video to Runway Gen-3: Import the recorded video for processing.
5. Extract 1st frame: Extract the first frame from the uploaded video.
6. Magnific Struct. Ref. 1st frame: Use Magnific to refine the structure of the first frame.
7. Upload and process: Upload the refined frame to Runway Gen-3 for further processing and stylization.
