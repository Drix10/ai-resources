### 🤖 GSO-SLAM - Bidirectionally Coupled Gaussian Splatting and Direct Visual Odometry

This article introduces GSO-SLAM, a novel approach integrating Gaussian Splatting with Direct Visual Odometry. It details the system's reliance on EM-based optimization for robust 3D scene reconstruction and accurate pose estimation.

Key Points:

• Integrates Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) with 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS).

• Utilizes Expectation-Maximization (EM) based optimization for enhanced performance.

• Achieves robust 3D scene reconstruction from visual input.

• Provides accurate camera pose estimation during navigation.

• Represents a significant advancement in real-time SLAM systems.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Integrate Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO): Establish robust camera pose tracking.
2. Incorporate 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS): Represent the scene with dense, high-fidelity visuals.
3. Apply EM-based Optimization: Refine both pose and scene representation iteratively.
