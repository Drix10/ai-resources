### ü§ñ Robotics - Vision-Based Robot Control

This article describes a method for controlling robots using visual perception. The core concept involves learning a controllable robot model by using visual input to understand which actions affect specific 3D points in space.  The robot essentially learns to move by observing its own actions.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢  This approach leverages visual perception for robot control.


‚Ä¢  The robot learns a model by associating visual input with actions.


‚Ä¢  This method allows the robot to "learn to move by seeing itself."
