### 💡 Data Quality - Dataset Evaluation Best Practices

This article highlights the prevalent issue of poor data quality in machine learning datasets, even those from reputable sources. It discusses practical methods for evaluating dataset integrity and identifying potential flaws.

Key Points:

• Many public and award-winning datasets can exhibit poor quality.

• It is critical to verify dataset integrity to maintain trust.

• Manual inspection for 30 minutes can reveal significant quality issues.

• Model-based evaluation involves comparing performance of blind and non-blind models.

🚀 Implementation:
1. Conduct manual review: Spend 30 minutes randomly inspecting dataset samples for anomalies.
2. Perform model comparison (for vision): Finetune a model with and without access to labels.
3. Analyze performance differences: Compare results between models to identify data inconsistencies.
