### 💡 Rust Programming - Judicious Use of Unsafe

This article provides guidance on the appropriate use of `unsafe` constructs in Rust programming. It suggests that persistent reliance on `unsafe` might indicate suitability for C++ development.

Key Points:

• Rust prioritizes memory safety and prevents common programming errors.

• The `unsafe` keyword bypasses Rust's compile-time safety checks.

• Extensive use of `unsafe` can negate Rust's core safety advantages.

• Consider C++ if `unsafe` becomes a frequent necessity.
