### ü§ñ Large Language Models - Parallel Agent Collaboration

This article discusses challenges encountered when using multiple coding agents simultaneously on a large-scale project.  The focus is on the limitations observed when exceeding a certain codebase size.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Utilizing multiple coding agents can significantly speed up development for smaller projects.


‚Ä¢  Coordination among multiple agents becomes increasingly difficult as the project size grows (above 200k LOC).


‚Ä¢ Agent conflicts increase as project size increases, leading to overwriting and loss of work.
