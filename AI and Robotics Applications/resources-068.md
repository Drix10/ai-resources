### üí° AI - Language Models vs. Video Models

This article explores the differences in how language and video models learn, focusing on the concept of next-token and next-frame prediction.


Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Language models learn effectively from next-token prediction due to the inherent surprise and variability in language.


‚Ä¢ Video models struggle to learn effectively from next-frame prediction, which often involves less variation.


‚Ä¢ The nature of the data and prediction task explains the learning disparity.
