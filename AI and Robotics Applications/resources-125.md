### 🤖 AI Models - Externalized Skills Library

This article discusses a research paper on transforming past experiences into reusable skills for AI models. It details a method for mining "how-to" reasoning into a skills library and a shared workspace. At test time, the model accesses this in-context memory for improved performance.

Key Points:

• Enables turning past experiences into reusable AI skills.

• Facilitates mining "how-to" reasoning into a centralized skills library.

• Supports a shared workspace for collaborative skill development.

• Improves model performance through in-context memory retrieval.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Mine "how-to" reasoning from diverse data sources.
2. Organize the extracted reasoning into a structured skills library.
3. Integrate the skills library into a collaborative shared workspace.
4. Enable the model to access this memory in-context during operations.
