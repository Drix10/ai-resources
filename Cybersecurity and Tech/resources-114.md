### üöÄ Cybersecurity - Certificate-Based Privilege Escalation

This article describes an advanced privilege escalation technique that leverages scheduled tasks to obtain administrator certificates, presenting an alternative to traditional LSASS dumping methods. The technique is automated within the NetExec framework.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Dumping LSASS is considered an outdated method for privilege escalation.

‚Ä¢ A new technique involves creating scheduled tasks to request certificates.

‚Ä¢ Obtaining these certificates grants elevated administrative privileges.

‚Ä¢ The `schtask_as` module in NetExec automates this process.


üöÄ Implementation:
1. Establish local administrator access on the target server.
2. Create a scheduled task to request a certificate on behalf of an admin.
3. Securely retrieve the newly generated certificate.
4. Utilize the acquired certificate to escalate privileges.
