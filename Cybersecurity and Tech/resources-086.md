### 🤖 Security - Concealing Shell Commands

This article details a method for concealing shell commands from users on a host system by leveraging mount namespaces and tmpfs.

Key Points:

• Using a non-systemd mount namespace isolates the shell's filesystem.


• Mounting a tmpfs filesystem within the namespace creates temporary storage.


• Data written to the mounted path is invisible to the host's users.


• Commands in this shell won't be written to the history file.



🚀 Implementation:

1. Identify an unused mount namespace (not used by systemd/init).
2. Migrate the current shell to this namespace.
3. Mount a tmpfs filesystem within the new namespace.
