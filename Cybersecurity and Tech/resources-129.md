### 🤖 Cybersecurity - Preventing Log-Based Attacks

This article examines the critical security risks associated with applications that blindly trust and interpret logged user input, as exemplified by the Log4j vulnerability. It highlights how attackers exploit this trust for malicious code execution.

Key Points:

• Logging user-controlled input without sanitization creates security vulnerabilities.

• Log4j demonstrated the potential for remote code execution via log interpretation.

• Attackers can inject malicious payloads into logs for system compromise.

• Strict input validation and output encoding are essential for prevention.

🚀 Implementation:
1. Sanitize all user-controlled input before logging to prevent injection.
2. Configure logging frameworks to avoid interpreting log entries as code.
3. Implement least privilege principles for logging components.
4. Regularly audit logs for suspicious patterns and attempted injections.
