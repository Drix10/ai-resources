### 🤖 Endpoint Security - Validating EDR Effectiveness

This article discusses the critical distinction between EDR visibility and validation. It highlights the importance of actively testing EDR defenses to ensure actual protection against threats.

Key Points:

• Visibility shows what tools detect; validation confirms they function.

• Identify coverage gaps and evaluate policy effectiveness.

• Correlate activity with EDR and SIEM logs for comprehensive analysis.

• Map actions to MITRE ATT&CK for measurable security outcomes.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Identify Coverage Gaps: Analyze your current EDR setup for potential weaknesses.
2. Evaluate Policy Quality: Assess the effectiveness of existing security policies.
3. Correlate Logs: Integrate EDR and SIEM logs to get a complete activity picture.
4. Retest After Tuning: Verify that implemented fixes and changes are effective.
