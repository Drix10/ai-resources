### 🤖 Solana - Account Model Notes

This article provides notes on the Solana account model, covering data accounts and program accounts.  It details the structure and functionalities of different account types within the Solana ecosystem.

Key Points:

• Solana stores all data in accounts, using a public accounts table.


• Data accounts store on-chain program state; they are not executable and owned by the program.


• Program accounts (legacy) store executable code directly in the data field; Program accounts (Loader v3+) point to a separate Program Data Account.
