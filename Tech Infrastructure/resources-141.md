### 🤖 Cloud Primitives - Two-Phase Programs

This article explores the concept of cloud primitives and how programs are structured in a two-phase deployment model. It details the separation of resource planning from runtime code execution in cloud environments.

Key Points:

• Cloud primitives represent fundamental building blocks for cloud applications.

• The "Plan" phase defines the necessary cloud resources for deployment.

• The "Runtime" phase involves deploying the application code to the cloud.

• This two-phase approach clearly separates infrastructure definition from application logic.


🚀 Implementation:
1. Define Resources with "Plan" Code: Write code that specifies cloud infrastructure components.
2. Deploy "Runtime" Code to Cloud: Package and deploy the application logic onto the defined resources.
