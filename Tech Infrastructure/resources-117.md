### 💡 Scalable System Design - Handling Unpredictable Traffic

This article outlines critical principles for designing resilient systems capable of managing unpredictable traffic spikes and maintaining performance.

Key Points:

• Favor stateless services for enhanced scalability and flexibility.

• Utilize asynchronous paths and queues to decouple services.

• Implement backpressure and fast autoscaling for traffic management.

• Remove global locks to prevent performance bottlenecks.

• Cache data aggressively to reduce load on backend systems.

🚀 Implementation:
1. Design Stateless Services: Ensure services do not retain client state across requests.
2. Implement Async Communication: Use message queues for inter-service communication.
3. Configure Autoscaling: Set up infrastructure to automatically adjust resources based on demand.
4. Apply Caching Strategies: Introduce caching layers to store frequently accessed data.
5. Plan for Degradation: Define how the system will gracefully reduce functionality under stress.
