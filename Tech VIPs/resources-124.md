### 💡 Movie Classification - Defining Christmas Films

This article discusses the criteria for classifying a movie as a Christmas film, specifically addressing the common debate around movies like Die Hard. It proposes that a film's designation as a Christmas movie should depend on its plot's intrinsic reliance on holiday-specific elements.

Key Points:

• A Christmas movie's plot must inherently depend on Christmas events or accessories.

• Films that can easily be set in any other season without altering the core narrative are not Christmas movies.

• The setting merely occurring during December does not automatically qualify a film as a holiday movie.

• Die Hard's storyline is not exclusively tied to the Christmas period, allowing for a flexible setting.
