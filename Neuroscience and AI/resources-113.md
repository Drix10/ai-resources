### ü§ñ AI Generalization - Latent Learning Gap

This article discusses why AI sometimes fails to generalize and proposes episodic memory as a solution to bridge the latent learning gap.  The latent learning gap is a concept unifying observations from language model weaknesses and agent navigation challenges.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ AI's generalization failures often stem from limitations in learning and representing information.


‚Ä¢ The latent learning gap highlights the disconnect between learned parametric knowledge and real-world application.


‚Ä¢ Episodic memory, which stores specific experiences, can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.

### ü§ñ Server Response Times - Median Measurement

This article explains how to evaluate server response times using the distribution of measured values, focusing on the median as a key metric.  Higher percentiles are also considered for a complete understanding of performance.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ The median response time provides a central tendency measure of server performance.


‚Ä¢ Higher percentiles reveal tail latency and potential performance bottlenecks.


‚Ä¢  Analyzing response time distributions offers a more comprehensive view than single-point metrics.
