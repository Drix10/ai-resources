### 🤖 AI Research - LLM-Generated Proposals

This article discusses a study analyzing the novelty and plagiarism of research proposals generated by large language models (LLMs) compared to those written by experts.  A significant portion of LLM-generated proposals were found to be plagiarized.

Key Points:

• LLM-generated research ideas were rated as more novel than expert-written ones.


• A substantial percentage (≥24%) of LLM-generated proposals showed evidence of skillful plagiarism.


• Plagiarism detection tools failed to identify many instances of plagiarism in the LLM-generated proposals.
