### ü§ñ Language Model Pretraining - Efficiency through Formal Language Training

This article discusses a method to improve the efficiency of large language model pretraining by incorporating formal language training before natural language training.  The underlying mechanism is explained, referencing relevant linguistic theories.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Improved pretraining efficiency through staged training.


‚Ä¢ Leveraging formal language structures for foundational knowledge.


‚Ä¢ Enhanced model performance with reduced training time and resources.

### üí° Social Determinants of Health - Public Perception of Causality

This article examines a study investigating public perceptions of the causes of depression, poverty, and mortality, focusing on the relative importance of social versus non-social factors.  The findings highlight the perceived causal relationships between various factors and these outcomes.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Insecure housing, damp housing, food insecurity, unemployment, and financial insecurity were rated as highly causally important.


‚Ä¢ Causal ratings were highest for depression.


‚Ä¢ Social factors were perceived as more causally important for poverty than non-social factors.
