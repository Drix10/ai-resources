### ü§ñ Academic Credibility - Beyond Impact Factor

This article discusses the limitations of using impact factor as the sole metric for academic credibility and emphasizes the disconnect between citations and expertise.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Impact factor suffers from issues stemming from citation patterns and cliquishness.


‚Ä¢ Expertise is not always reflected in citation counts, and vice versa.

### ü§ñ Quantum Consciousness - Penrose Orchestrated Objective Reduction

This article explores the Penrose Orchestrated Objective Reduction (OR) theory of consciousness, focusing on the role of quantum collapse in generating conscious experience.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Collapse in Penrose OR occurs when entangled superpositions reach a threshold.


‚Ä¢ This collapse is proposed to cause a moment of proto-conscious or conscious experience.


‚Ä¢ The timing of collapse is described as t = h/EsubG.
