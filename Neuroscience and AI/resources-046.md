### ü§ñ Neuroscience - Biological Implausibility of Backpropagation

This article discusses the biological implausibility of backpropagation, a common neural network training algorithm, and introduces predictive coding as a biologically-inspired alternative.  The article explores the derivation of predictive coding.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Backpropagation's reliance on symmetrical weight updates is inconsistent with brain function.


‚Ä¢ Predictive coding offers a more biologically plausible learning mechanism.


‚Ä¢ Predictive coding is derived from minimizing prediction errors.

### üí° Economics - Impact of Market Rents on Homelessness

This article examines the relationship between market rents and the prevalence of homelessness, particularly comparing differences between states with varying housing policies.  The core argument is that low market rents are crucial for the effectiveness of housing vouchers.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Low market rents enable housing vouchers to effectively address homelessness.


‚Ä¢ High market rents render housing vouchers insufficient for many individuals.


‚Ä¢  Differences in market rents significantly affect homelessness rates across states.
