### ü§ñ Neuroscience - Parkinson's Disease Classification

This article discusses a research paper that uses a novel approach combining attention mechanisms from transformers with neuroscientific maps for Parkinson's disease classification from fMRI data.  The method adapts transformer architecture to incorporate biological information.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Novel approach combines deep learning with neuroscience.


‚Ä¢ Uses neurotransmitter and other brain maps in the classification model.


‚Ä¢ Improves accuracy in Parkinson's disease diagnosis from fMRI data.
