### ü§ñ Neuroscience - Tau Protein and Microtubules

This article discusses the role of tau protein and microtubules in cognitive function, specifically addressing the misconception that tau itself causes cognitive dysfunction.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Tau tangles are a consequence of microtubule disintegration.

‚Ä¢ Microtubule loss leads to memory impairment and reduced brain volume.

‚Ä¢  Reversing microtubule disintegration may reverse cognitive decline.
