### ü§ñ AI - Limitations of GOFAI

This article discusses the limitations of Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI) and argues against its potential for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ GOFAI methods are outdated and unlikely to lead to AGI.


‚Ä¢ Deep neural networks, while powerful, are essentially advanced statistical expert systems.


‚Ä¢  A true AGI revolution requires a paradigm shift beyond current approaches.

### üß† Neuroscience - Neural Encoding of Visual Stimuli

This article discusses a mouse study on neural encoding of visual stimuli, suggesting that stimulus features are encoded broadly across the brain, not solely within the visual cortex.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Stimulus features are represented widely throughout the brain.


‚Ä¢ Research should move beyond focusing solely on the visual cortex.


‚Ä¢ The ventral hippocampus plays a significant role in stimulus feature representation.
