### üß† Neuroscience - Sleep Patterns and Dementia Risk

A new study indicates that increased daytime sleepiness in women over 80 is associated with a doubled risk of developing dementia.  Nighttime sleep decline did not show a similar correlation.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Increased daytime sleepiness linked to higher dementia risk in women.


‚Ä¢  No significant link found between worsening nighttime sleep and dementia.


‚Ä¢ Study followed 733 women without initial cognitive impairment.
