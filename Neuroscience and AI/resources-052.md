### üî¨ Long COVID - Brain Fog Biological Markers

This article summarizes a study investigating the biological markers associated with brain fog in long COVID patients, comparing them to fully recovered individuals.  The research focuses on inflammation and stress markers as potential contributors to persistent cognitive symptoms.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Higher levels of IL-10, an inflammation marker, were found in long COVID patients.


‚Ä¢ Lower levels of nerve growth factor were observed, suggesting reduced neural adaptation capacity.


‚Ä¢  The study provides biological evidence supporting the link between persistent cognitive symptoms and long COVID.
