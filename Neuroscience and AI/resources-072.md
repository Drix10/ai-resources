### 🤖 Machine Learning - Jensen-Shannon Divergence vs. Kullback-Leibler Divergence

This article compares Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, highlighting the advantages of JS divergence, especially in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

Key Points:

•  JS divergence is a smoother and more symmetric alternative to KL divergence.


•  JS divergence is better suited for GANs.


•  JS divergence is not simply the average of two KL divergences, as is commonly believed.

### 🤖 Machine Learning -  Jensen-Shannon Divergence:  A Deeper Look

This article further explains the mathematical formula of Jensen-Shannon divergence and emphasizes its importance in applications like GANs.

Key Points:

•  JS divergence is defined as the average of two KL divergences, but from P and Q to their average, not to each other.


•  This difference is crucial.


•  JS is smoother, symmetric, and better for GANs due to its properties.
