### üí° AI Ethics - Moral Dialogue and Human Experience

This article discusses the risks of ceding moral dialogue to AI systems that lack human experience and stakes, arguing it could undermine the democratic process.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ Ceding moral dialogue to AI risks hollowing out democratic processes.

‚Ä¢  Human experience is crucial for ethical reasoning.

‚Ä¢ AI should be a tool, not a moral participant.


---
### üí° AI Ethics - AI as a Tool, Not a Moral Participant

This article proposes treating AI as a tool to enhance ethical discourse, rather than a moral participant, to identify blind spots while maintaining human accountability in decision-making.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ AI should be treated as a tool in ethical discourse.

‚Ä¢ AI can be used to map arguments and reveal blind spots.

‚Ä¢ Final deliberation should remain grounded in human experience.

### ü§ñ Image Diffusion Models - Locality and Data Statistics

This article summarizes a research paper investigating why diffusion models generalize. The paper argues that capturing data statistics, not necessarily neural networks, may be sufficient.

Key Points:

‚Ä¢ The research explores why diffusion models generalize.

‚Ä¢ Neural networks may not be essential for generalization.

‚Ä¢ Capturing data statistics might be sufficient for model performance.
