### 🤖 Cognitive Science - Memory Simulation

This article explores a contemporary view of human memory, suggesting it functions as a simulation process rather than a direct store-and-retrieve mechanism. It contrasts this with traditional software memory models and intuitive understandings.

Key Points:

• Human memory involves encoding representations.

• These representations are used to simulate past events.

• Memory is not a literal store and retrieve function.

• Pre-AI software often modeled memory as direct storage.

### 💡 Generative AI - Realistic Image Prompting

This article provides practical prompting tips for generative AI to create raw, documentary-style images. It emphasizes adding elements of imperfection to achieve a more realistic aesthetic in generated art.

Key Points:

• Add "motion blur" to prompts for dynamic movement.

• Incorporate "high ISO noise" for a gritty, authentic feel.

• Include "overexposed highlights" to mimic real-world lighting.

• Use "dutch angle" for a unique, cinematic composition.

• Prioritize realism over typical perfection in AI generated images.

🚀 Implementation:
1. Begin with a descriptive prompt for your desired image scene.
2. Append "motion blur" to introduce realistic motion artifacts.
3. Add "high ISO noise" to simulate film grain or low-light conditions.
4. Include "overexposed highlights" for photographic realism.
5. Finish with "dutch angle" to create a distinct perspective.
